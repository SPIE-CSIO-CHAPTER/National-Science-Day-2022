You might be aware that **28th February** is celebrated as **National Science Day** in India but do you know why and for what the day is celebrated as National Science Day.

- I am also sure you must have heard about celebrated **Indian Scientist Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman**. 
- On this day in **1928**, he discovered a phenomenon of **scattering of photons which was later known as â€˜Raman Effectâ€™** after his name. 
- After two years in 1930, he got Nobel Prize for this remarkable discovery and this was the first Nobel Prize for India in the field of Science.

 ## To mark the discovery of his famous phenomenon National Science Day, SPIE-CSIO celebrated this year invited young school minds and utilized the outreach grant to demonstrated these effects, hence acheiving the SPIE vision to sharpen and motivate young minds about the field of light.

## When was the day declared as National Science Day?

In 1986, the National Council for Science and Technology Communication (NCSTC) asked the Government of India to designate 28 February as National Science Day which the then Govt. of India accepted and declared the day as National Science Day in 1986. The first National Science Day was celebrated on February 28, 1987.

## What is Raman Effect?

- Raman Effect is a phenomenon in spectroscopy discovered by the eminent physicist while working in the laboratory of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata.
- Raman Effect, change in the wavelength of light that occurs when a light beam is deflected by molecules. When a beam of light traverses a dust-free, transparent sample of a chemical compound, a small fraction of the light emerges in directions other than that of the incident (incoming) beam. Most of this scattered light is of unchanged wavelength. A small part, however, has wavelengths different from that of the incident light; its presence is a result of the Raman Effect.

## Purpose of the Celebration:

The basic objective of observation of National Science Day is to spread the message of importance of science and its application among the people. National science day is celebrated as one of the main science festivals in India every year with following purpose-

- To widely spread a message about the significance of scientific applications in the daily life of the people,
- To display all the activities, efforts and achievements in the field of science for welfare of human being,
- To discuss all the issues and implement new technologies for the development of the science,
- To give an opportunity to the scientific minded citizens in the country,
- To encourage the people as well as popularize the Science and Technology.
